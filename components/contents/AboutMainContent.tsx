        Arefel is a technology-enabled food processing company that is deploying
        an ML-powered food value chain management platform and cutting-edge food

      <p className="lg:mb-5">
        Today, about 40% of food produced by human consumption by African
        farmers disappears from the supply chain annually due to postharvest
        losses. These losses are usually a consequence of farmersâ€™ restricted
        market access and lack of dependable production and postharvest
        management knowledge and support.{" "}
      </p>
      <p className="lg:mb-5">
        Postharvest losses reduce the income and threaten the livelihoods of
        smallholder farmers, release GHGs that degrade our environment, cause
        massive wastage of expensive agricultural inputs (e.g. fertilizers,
        pesticides, seeds, etc.) and hugely constrain natural resources (e.g.
        freshwater, scarce land, fertile soil, etc.), and threaten food and
        nutrition security in Africa.
