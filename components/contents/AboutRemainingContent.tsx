        All these are happening at a time when many sub-Saharan African
        countries are facing massive hunger and malnutrition problems, high food
        importation bills, and rising food price inflation and volatility. And
        to make matters worse, in many African countries, residents typically
        spend about half their income on food.

      <p className="lg:mb-5">
        With the world population projected to be about 10 billion by 2050 and
        Africa projected to contribute about one-fourth of that, addressing
        Africa’s severe postharvest loss problems is a low-hanging fruit in the
        quest for the food and nutrition security necessary to cater for
        Africa’s fast-rising population.
      </p>
      <p className="lg:mb-5">
        By leveraging our value chain management technology platform and food
        product and process innovations, we transform perishable produce grown
        by African farmers, mostly smallholders, into innovative food products,n
        to fulfill the massive food and nutritional demands of Africans in
        cities and the diaspora.
      </p>
      <p className="lg:mb-5">
        Our solution provides smallholder farmers with more income since we
        serve high-value markets and increase produce output per ha for farmers
        (since they incur minimal losses), thereby improving food and nutrition
        security in Africa. Our vision is to be a dominant technology-enabled
        player in Africa’s massive urban foods market, a respected market leader
        in the global export of branded African foods, and a scalable food
        technology solutions provider.
